Adds a command to directly open the Community plugins browser.


# How to install

Download the latest **community-cmd** [release](https://github.com/MrBertie/community/releases), unzip it, and drop the folder into your `{Obsidian Vault}/.obsidian/plugins` folder.  Edit the plugin folder name to remove the version number, e.g. `-v.0.1.1`, and then restart Obsidian.

# How to use

Open `Community Plugins Browser` from the command palette, or add a button to the Ribbon if you need regular, quickly access.
